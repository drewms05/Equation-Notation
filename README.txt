Welcome! This is a fun little Python program I developed
which takes in an equation (either in postfix or infix notation),
and then automatically detects which notation it is in before 
generating the opposite and solving it. You are welcome to 
use it in your own personal projects, provided you contact me beforehand.
Please do not use this program for commercial purposes.
